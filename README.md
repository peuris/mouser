# Introduction
Recoil management script - tested with PUBG

## Getting Started
to use this repository, install required packages:

1. Python 3.8+
2. pywin32==303

using the following command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
## Using
run app.py

## In the game
When caps lock is activated (pressed down) the script runs thru the activities.
modus[n].py "configuration files" can be activated with pressing left ctrl+[1-7], script will import values from selected modus.
PUBG should be run borderless, otherwise overlay function will capture screen for a second (same as you would do with alt+tab). You can also comment out the overlay starting process to avoid app switchin in full screen mode.
